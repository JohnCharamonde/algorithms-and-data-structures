// A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.

// They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.

// Two rectangles overlapping a little. It must be love.
// Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.

// As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.

// They are defined as objects â†´ like this:

  const myRectangle = {

  // Coordinates of bottom-left corner
  leftX: 1,
  bottomY: 1,

  // Width and height
  width: 6,
  height: 3,
};

// JavaScript
// Your output rectangle should use this format as well.

// function findRectangularOverlap(rect1, rect2) {

//     let overlap = { leftX: null, bottomY: null, width: null, height: null };

//     // Calculate the overlap between the two rectangles
//     let findXOverlap = (rect1, rect2) => {
//         if(rect1.leftX <= rect2.leftX) {
//             if((rect1.leftX + rect1.width) >= rect2.leftX) {
//                 overlap.leftX = rect2.leftX;
//                 overlap.width = Math.min((rect1.leftX + rect1.width - overlap.leftX), (rect2.leftX + rect2.width - overlap.leftX));
